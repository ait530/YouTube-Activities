// Below is an array, always starts at index value 0.
// var animals = ["Zebra", "Rhino", "Giraffe", "Owl"];


var animals = ["Zebra", "Rhino", "Giraffe", "Owl", "Dog"];


// Prints in console
// Prints zebra 
// console.log(animals[0]);
// Prints Rhino, and so on...
// console.log(animals[1]);
// console.log(animals[2]);
// console.log(animals[3]);

// var length = animals.length
// console.log(length);




// For Loop:
// The counter is i (standard, technically could be anything

// i is an integer


// i=0 starts at 0
// as long as i (integer) is less than the length of the animals array, do whatever is between the brackets (in this case, 0 < 4)

// Once that is done, increment the number and start over

// i++ means increment (increase) the number and start over



//variable i starts at 0; is 0 less than the length of animals (in this case it's 4)?; if it is, then go ahead and console.log i's current value (in this case, it's console.log[0]) which is zebra; then start loop again at [1] (zebra); then again for [2], then [3]...; once the loop goes to [4], then it exists the loop since 4 is not < 4.

for (var i=0; i<animals.length; i++){
  console.log(animals[i]);
}


// You can add to an array, and it will still console.log since it is only influenced by the length of the array
